## Investigating Implicit Inverse Kinematics in LGTM: A Text-Driven Motion Diffusion Model
### Abstract
This report details our efforts to re-implement the LGTM (Local-to-Global Text-Driven Human Motion Diffusion Model) introduced by Sun et al. (2024). Emphasis is placed on critical implementation steps, specifically preparing the HumanML3D dataset, training Text–Motion Retrieval (TMR) encoders, and accurately reproducing the LGTM diffusion model. We present a comprehensive pipeline, document encountered challenges, and propose solutions to ensure reproducibility.
